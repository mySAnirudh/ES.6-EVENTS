     JavaScript is meant to add interactivity to your pages. JavaScript does this using a 
mechanism using events. Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 
3 and every HTML element contains a set of events that can trigger JavaScript Code.
An event is an action or occurrence recognized by the software. It can be triggered by a 
user or the system. Some common examples of events include a user clicking on a button, 
loading the web page, clicking on a hyperlink and so on. Following are some of the common 
HTML events. 
Event Handlers
On the occurrence of an event, the application executes a set of related tasks. The block 
of code that achieves this purpose is called the eventhandler. Every HTML element has 
a set of events associated with it. We can define how the events will be processed in 
JavaScript by using event handlers. 
onclick Event Type
This is the most frequently used event type which occurs when a user clicks the left button 
of his mouse. You can put your validation, warning, etc. against this event type.
